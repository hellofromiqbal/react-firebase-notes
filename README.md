# REACT-FIREBASE-NOTES

This is a project about the app which allows us to create some notes. 
I've built this app to learn deeper about CRUD concepts, React JS and Firebase at the same time.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
